## Libraries and Framework

1. Fetch API was used to make api calls to serve content
2. Redux was used for global state management
3. Immer was used to manage local state

## Target Platform

- Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer
- iOS 11.0 or newer

## Technical Decisions

- Re-usable components were created following the atomic design. Example is **Text** which was evident in several part of the screens with only colour and sizes changing.
